I wrote a a class that represents a manager at a company. The Manager class is be derived from the Employee class. A Manager is an Employee, except that a manager has a fixed bonus that is paid at every pay period. My Manager derived class has a private instance variable for the
bonus, plus a redefined function calcPay() that calculates the pay of the manager. To calculate the pay of a manager, I calculate the wage of an employee using that classâ€™s calcPay() method, and then add the bonus. It prompts the user for the number of managers, and then for each manager, itb reads the name, wage, hours worked, and bonus from the user. It will then determine which manager is most highly paid, and the
average pay of all the managers
